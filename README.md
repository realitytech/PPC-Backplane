# PPC-Backplane
Amstrad PPC640 and PPC512 Internal PC104 Backplane

This adds an internal PC104 compatible slot to the PPC640 and PPC512 in the modem bay.
The board is designed to fit inside the machine soldering on the underside of the main board but can be fitted with through hole sockets and used externally too for testing and development.

This is the inital release version and corrects a few issues with the very first issue.
